      <ul>
      	<li><p>In the past, pixels were the preferred method for sizing fonts because they gave the designer precise control of the browsers font size.  Unfortunately, fixed based fonts have several problems:</li><ol><li>They are not accessible because they override the users preferred browser font size setting.</li><li>They have no cascade - that is, the font size of the parent element has no effect on the font size of the child element.  That means you need to set a specific pixel size for each element where you want the text to display at a different size.  This leads to maintenance issues.</p></li></ol>
      	<li><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> Sizing fonts in pixels is not a future-friendly approach because different devices have different screen sizes and pixel densities.  As a result, a pixel-based font that looks good on one divice may be too small on another.</p></li>
