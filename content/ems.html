        <ul>
          <li><p>A much more flexible way of sizing fonts is to use ems.  One <em>em</em> is equal to the current font size.  If the body text is 16px then 1em = 16px; 2em = 32px;  Ems are resizable across browsers and they also cascade - that is, the font size of the parent element effects the font size of the child element.</p></li>
          <li><p><span>This is an example of the cascading issue when using ems.  This <em>span</em> element's font-size is set to 1 em in CSS.  And its actual size is calculated as 1em of its parent <em>p</em> tag resulting in a size of 18px.  With rems, we can avoid cascading issues that occur because rems calculate their base on the <em>html</em> element.</span></p></li>
          <li><p><strong>TIP:</strong> When using ems it is recommended to set the base font in percentages to avoid a resizing issue that Internet Explorer has.  IE's resizing for differing em sizing isn't consistent with other browsers (see p31, Implementing Responsive Design).</p></li>
